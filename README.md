#### [FA18] Beyond Worst Case Analysis

- `lec3-spectral-planted-clique` implements the AKS spectral algorithm for recovering a planted clique of size O(sqrt(k)).
- `lec6-approx-sbm.ipynb` implements the spectral algorithm for approximately recovering partitions in a Stochastic Block Model.
- `lec7-exact-sbm.ipynb` implements the SDP algorithm for exactly recovering partitions in a Stochastic Block Model.
